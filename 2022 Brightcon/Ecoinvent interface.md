# Ecoinvent Brightway interface

Some aspects of working with data produced by the ecoinvent association are currently suboptimal. This project will reconfigure the way that Brightway gets data, metadata, and documentation from ecoinvent, both improving current processes and adding new functionality.

To see the specific tasks, use the issue filters `brightcon` and `ecoinvent-interface`.
