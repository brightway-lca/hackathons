# Brightway hackathons organization

Hackathons need some structure to be productive. This repo allows people running hackathons on Brightway to have a central organization point without being too prescriptive on how hackthons or project ideas are set up.

## Brightcon 2023

The hackathon topics are given as [issues in the hackathons repo](https://github.com/brightway-lca/hackathons/labels/brightcon2023). Around 30 people are registered for the hackathon.

The hackathon runs from 10:00 (registration at 9:30) Saturday morning to 17:00 on Sunday. Hackathon participants are invited to a social evening on Sunday evening.

Hackthon results should be presented on Wednesday, Sept. 20, at 13:00.

## Brightcon 2022

We currently have the following project ideas for the [Brightcon 2022 hackathon](https://2022.brightcon.link/hackathon); they are organized as issues.

* Improve the programmatic interface to ecoinvent: Make it easy to get links to process webpages and PDFs, building on the EIDL. Tag `ecoinvent-interface`
* Improve the documentation: Come up with a new outline, split up the "introduction" webpage into different sections, use the [Jupyter Book](https://github.com/brightway-lca/jupyter-book-brightway-documentation) format and in general follow the [Brightway3 guidelines](https://github.com/orgs/brightway-lca/projects/2). Tag `documentation`
* Make LCA calculation reproducible. Tag `reproducible`
* Make Brightway work with the ILCD format. Tag `ILCD`
* Design document for how a family of LCIA methods should be stored and used in `MultiLCA`. Tag `method-family`.
