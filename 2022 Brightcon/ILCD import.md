# Add import for ILCD data format

We want to enable Brightway to read datasets in ILCD format. This project will add functionality to obtain ILCD data from the file system or soda4LCA node, extract the most important information and write it into the database.

To see the specific tasks, use the issue filters `brightcon` and `ILCD` (type `label:brighton` and `label:ILCD` in the [search bar of the issues](https://github.com/brightway-lca/hackathons/issues), or select the labels from the "Label" drop-down menu also in the [issues](https://github.com/brightway-lca/hackathons/issues).
